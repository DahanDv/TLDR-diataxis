This isn't a hard template, but a very fluid one which you can use as a starting point that will remind you the most important Do's and Don'ts of putting together a good How-to Guide. 
If you are not sure wether its a tutorial or how-to or any other type of docs that you need to create, consider reading the README of this project.

## Golden rules for excellent How-to Guide
1. How-to Guide aims at answering a close-ended question

2. How-to Guides guides the user needs and helps them accomplish their goals reliably.
(a long list of how to guides in your documentation is a strong signal to the usability of the product and a strong encourage for users to commit of learning how to use it.)

3. Focus on the user and not on the product features
Keep asking yourself what the user needs.
By all means: avoid defining your How-to Guide by what your product can do and its features. the user coudln't care less. They want to get something done. Focus on their needs and don't romantasize on your novel work. 

4. Beware of Pseudo Guidence
Consider:
    - *"To shut off the flow of water, turn the tap clockwise."*
    - *"To deploy the desired database configuration, select the appropriate options and press `Deploy`."*


5. Focus on the goal
    anything else is a distraciton to the usefullness style of the guide. 
    a common mistake is to explain and provide reference for completeness. these should have their own place in your docs and they are standing in the user's way (link to them if it's so important).

6. Address real-world complexity


7. omit the unnecessary - practical usability is more helpful than completeness.

8. Seek flow
    - avoid context switching.
    - consider what you are asking the user to think about and how will their thinking flow form subject to subject.
    - how long the user is told to hold something in their memory until it resolves into action? (should be as little as possible).
