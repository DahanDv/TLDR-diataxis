# TLDR-diataxis
(WIP)
This project aims to be a short and accessible guide for the [The Diátaxis documentation framework](https://diataxis.fr/).

## Goal
Create a reduced version of the document: [The Diátaxis documentation framework](https://diataxis.fr/).
The guide should explain briefly and reduce the framework to a list of guidelines, "Do's and Dont's," with some accompanying examples so anyone who writes documentation can quickly check on themselves.
This reduced version of Diataxis won't cover [The Diátaxis documentation framework](https://diataxis.fr/) in its Orthodox interpretation. 
However, it is better than the Wild West of documentation we suffer from today, and it may encourage some to go deeper on the matter and perfect their docs. 

## Motivation
[The Diátaxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/) is a comprehensive guide for maintainers to build great docs. 
The sad truth is - most people won't (or can't) make the time to learn it.
Understandably, documenting takes time and effort. And learning [The Diátaxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/) also takes time. 

In order to encourage more maintainers to adopt [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) as a standard for their docs, either via their own craft or by outside, one-time contributors - we need to make this knowledge more accessible and digestible.
